## Introduction

The Heart Disease Prediction System helps identify individuals at high risk of heart disease, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care and treatment options. The system improves patient outcomes by identifying potential heart disease at an earlier stage, allowing for early interventions.

## Motivation

The project aims to develop a heart disease prediction system using advanced algorithms and models to analyze medical data. The system considers various risk factors such as age, gender, high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diabetes to provide an accurate risk assessment. It is designed to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care and treatment options.

## Objectives

- Identify individuals at high risk of heart disease
- Assist healthcare professionals in decision-making
- Improve patient outcomes with early detection and intervention
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy data input and access

## Limitations of Existing Systems

- Predicts only a single type of disease
- Limited performance evaluation
- Risk of overfitting
- Inability to detect subtle changes
- Complexity in medical diagnosis
- Regulatory and ethical considerations

## Proposed Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant medical data including age, sex, CP, RBP, CHOL, FBS, etc.
2. **Data Processing:** Process the data using machine learning models.
3. **Model Development:** Build predictive algorithms using SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
4. **Model Training and Validation:** Train and validate the model on the dataset.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the system for real-world use, ensuring regular updates for accuracy.
